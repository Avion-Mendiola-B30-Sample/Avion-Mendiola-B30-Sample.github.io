          <h3>What is Google?</h3>
          <p>Google is a search engine that was registered on 15th September 1997 and the company got incorporated on 4th September 1998. The founders of Google, Larry and Sergey invented Google's PageRank algorithm together. They initially named Google “BackRub” as the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site.

The founders of Google later changed the name to Google, inspired by the word “Googol.” This name was picked to signify that the search engine was initiated to provide information in huge quantities.</p>
